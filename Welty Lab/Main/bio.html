				Eudora Alice Welty was born in Jackson, Mississippi on April 13, 1909, the daughter of Christian Webb Weltry (1897-1931) and Mary Chestina (Andrews) Welty (1883-1966). She grew up with younger brothers Edward Jefferson and Walter Andrews. Her mother was a schoolteacher. Eudora soon developed a love of reading reinforced by her mother, who believed that "any room in our house, at any time in the day, was there to read in, or to be read to." Her father, who worked as an insurance executive, was intrigued by gadgets and machines and inspired in Eudora a love of all things mechanical. She later used technology for symbolism in her stories and also became an avid photographer, like her father.

				Near the time of her high school graduation, Welty moved with her family to a house built for them at 1119 Pinehurst Street, which remained her permanent addresss until her death. Wyatt C. Hedrick designed the Weltys' Tudor Revival style home, which is now known as the Eudora Welty House and Garden.

				Welty studied at the Mississippi State College for Women from 1925 to 1927, then transferred to the University of Wisconsin to complete her studies in English literature. At the suggestion of her father, she studied advertising at Columbia University. Because she graduated in the depths of the Great Depresssion, she struggled to find work in New York.

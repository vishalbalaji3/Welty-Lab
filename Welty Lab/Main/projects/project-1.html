					Powerhouse is playing! He’s here on tour from the city — “Powerhouse and His Keyboard” — “Powerhouse and His Keyboard” — <a class="blue-info" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="right" data-offset="90 90" data-trigger="focus" data-content="The name associates the supporting band with a remote geography and an aboriginal people.">“Powerhouse and His Tasmanians”</a> — think of the things he calls himself! There’s no one in the world like him. You can’t tell what he is. “Nigger man”?—he looks more Asiatic, monkey, Jewish, Babylonian, Peruvian, fanatic, devil. He has pale gray eyes, heavy lids, maybe horny like a lizard’s, but big glowing eyes when they’re open. He has African feet of the greatest size, stomping, both together, on each side of the pedals. And if you could hear him at this moment on <a class="purple-info" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="left" data-offset="40 40" data-trigger="focus" data-content="The name associates the supporting band with a remote geography and an aboriginal people.">“Marie, the Dawn is Breaking”</a>! He’s going up the keyboard with a few fingers in some very derogatory triplet-routine, he gets higher and higher, and then he looks over the end of the piano, as if over a cliff. But not in a show-off way—the song makes him do it.
				</p>
    			<p class="text-indent">
    				Is it possible that he could be this! When you have him there performing for you, that’s what you feel. You [end p. 253] know people on a stage—and people of a darker race—so likely to be marvelous, frightening.
    			</p>
    			<p class="text-indent">
    				This is a white dance. Powerhouse is not a show-off like the Harlem boys, not drunk, not crazy—he’s in a trance; he’s a person of joy, a fanatic. He listens as much as he performs, a look of hideous, powerful rapture on his face. Big arched eyebrows that never stop traveling, like a Jew’s—wandering-Jew eyebrows. When he plays he beats down piano and seat and wears them away. He is in motion every moment—what could be more obscene? There he is with his great head, fat stomach, and little round piston legs, and long yellow-sectioned strong big fingers, at rest about the size of bananas. Of course you know how he sounds—you’ve heard him on records—but still you need to see him. He’s going all the time, like skating around the skating rink or rowing a boat. It makes everybody crowd around, here in this shadowless steel-trussed hall with the rose-like posters of Nelson Eddy and the testimonial for the mind-reading horse in handwriting magnified five hundred times. Then all quietly he lays his finger on a key with the promise and serenity of a sibyl touching the book.
				</p>
				<p class="text-indent">
					Powerhouse is so monstrous he sends everybody into oblivion. When any group, any performers, come to town, don’t people always come out and hover near, leaning inward about them, to learn what it is? What is it? Listen. Remember how it was with the acrobats. Watch them carefully, hear the least word, especially what they say to one another, in another language—don’t let them escape you; it’s the only time for hallucination, [end p. 254] the last time. They can’t stay. They’ll be somewhere else this time tomorrow.
